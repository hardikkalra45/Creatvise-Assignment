Implement Group and Ungroup Functionality for Vector Shapes/objects.

Grouping Functionality.
- Users should be able to select multiple shapes/objects on the canvas.
- Add a "Group" button in the UI that, when clicked, groups the selected
shapes into one entity.
- Once grouped, the collection of shapes should move, resize, and rotate
together as a single object.
Ungrouping Functionality
- Provide an "Ungroup" button that, when clicked, breaks the grouped shapes
back into individual shapes.
- Once ungrouped, each shape should be individually draggable, resizable, and
rotatable again.
- Add a visual indication (like a bounding box or highlight) around grouped
shapes to show they are grouped.
- Allow the user to select and manipulate multiple groups.
